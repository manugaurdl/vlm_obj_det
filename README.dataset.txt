# Introduction
This dataset contains images of water meter readings with the purpose of digitizing the numeric values. There are 10 classes representing the digits 0 through 9. Annotators will label the digits as they appear on the meters to facilitate accurate recognition.

# Object Classes

## 0
### Description
The digit "0" is characterized by its oval or circular shape, often with a distinctive horizontal thickness.

### Instructions
- Annotate the entire visible area of the digit, ensuring the bounding box captures the full curvature without cutting into adjacent digits. 
- Do not label if only partially visible or distorted beyond recognition.

## 1
### Description
The digit "1" typically appears as a straight vertical line, sometimes with a short horizontal base.

### Instructions
- Draw a bounding box around the full length of the digit, including any visible base. Ensure clear vertical alignment, and avoid labeling if obscured by glare or shadows.

## 2
### Description
The digit "2" has a curved top and straight middle section, finishing with a horizontal or diagonal stroke at the base.

### Instructions
- Ensure that the bounding box covers the entire silhouette, from the curved top to the base. 
- Avoid labeling if any section is visibly missing or incomplete.

## 3
### Description
The digit "3" is identified by two stacked curved sections without intersecting lines.

### Instructions
- Capture both curvatures completely within the bounding box.
- Ensure that no parts are obscured by reflections or meter shadows before labeling.

## 4
### Description
The digit "4" often features intersecting horizontal and vertical lines with a triangle-like top section.

### Instructions
- Include the intersecting lines and full top section within the bounding box. 
- Avoid labeling if structural lines are affected by wear or visibility issues.

## 5
### Description
The digit "5" combines a prominent upper loop with a lower horizontal stroke and a straight vertical line.

### Instructions
- Enclose the loop and strokes fully within the bounding box. 
- Ensure separation from neighboring digits, and do not label if substantial parts are unclear or missing.

## 6
### Description
The digit "6" features a closed top loop with an extended lower curve that continues downward.

### Instructions
- Draw the bounding box to encompass both the loop and the extended curve, ensuring clarity and complete visibility. 
- Avoid labeling partially obstructed digits.

## 7
### Description
The digit "7" is characterized by a horizontal top line connecting to a diagonal downward stroke.

### Instructions
- Include the horizontal and diagonal lines entirely in the bounding box. 
- Check for clarity and distinction from shadows before labeling.

## 8
### Description
The digit "8" resembles two stacked circles or loops, one above the other.

### Instructions
- Ensure the bounding box captures both loops. 
- Confirm that the digit is not overlapping with others and is entirely visible before labeling.

## 9
### Description
The digit "9" starts with a circular or elliptical loop at the top, leading into a straight downward stroke.

### Instructions
- The bounding box should cover the complete loop and the straight line. 
- Do not annotate if any parts are obscured or not clearly discernible.
